            Its very unhealthy, but I listen to music all the time and it certainly helps me work better while calming me down. I have 5000+ hours on Spotify and listen to all sorts of different genres including things like Rap, Lo-Fi, Ambient, Phonk, etc.
            <br><br>
            I first got into technology by curiosity in 2021, and due to the way I like to experiment and constantly mess around with things I picked it up really fast, dunno what else I'd be good at if it wasn't technology.
