description: I have remade the website again! This time I have actually taken the time to perfect it and build it from scratch, it has pretty much all the same stuff as my old wordpress website but with a cooler and more unique design
slug: new-website

I have now remade the website once again! This time using html, css, python, docker and docker compose. All of the code for this website is open source on my github page in the A3D-Website repository.

I have been working on this project for the past few days. Building a website, cdn and the next thing im going to work on is an api server, which I also need to write documentation for.

Last time I didn't enjoy web development because I was just using google gemini and chatgpt for everything, this time im doing some learning myself. You can still access all of my old websites: [Old Website](https://v1-website.a3d.pro) and my [Legacy Website](https://legacy-atomic2ds-page.a3d.pro), they are currently running on Cloudflare pages and my old vps server. I plan to keep them online for as long as I can but they will likely be taken down eventually.
