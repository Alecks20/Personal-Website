## Introduction
I have been programming for only about a year at this point, so far im really enjoying it. The pace, flexibility, freedom and much more makes me enjoy doing it over stuff like gaming. At this point im not sure what part of the tech industry to go into and get a job in or if I'm even gonna get a job here.

## My first projects
The first actual project I built with code was a Discord bot in Python. It was just a simple little project I wanted to work on because I thought it would be cool having my own discord bot. It was at that point that I started to love the flexibility and freedom you got with programming your own stuff.

## Year of slow progression
For about a year I continually developed and worked on my Discord bot to improve it even more, during this process I learned some valuable skills like: 

- Knowing how to deploy my app using Docker and Docker Compose
- Knowing how to integrate a MongoDB database into my server and also deploy and connect one using Docker networking
- Being familiar with Linux servers and the command line, I also learned security concepts later down the line. (SSH Security, Backup solutions, Disaster Recovery, etc)

## Present Day
I'm currently learning how to write and code websites using HTML and CSS, I also want to learn Javascript so I can enhance my websites even further, im learning most stuff from freeCodeCamp, ChatGPT/Google Gemini and also just playing around with stuff myself.

Remember I'm just getting started at this point, theres still much more to come and im still young.
