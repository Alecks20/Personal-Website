slug: huge-website-revamp


I was using wordpress for ~2 months and I just got bored of it, yeah there was some cool themes and all but nothing really let me express myself or make my website unique. All the themes were just corporate junk with no personality and nothing cool on them.

Thats why I moved back to my Python/Flask based website (Soon to be Django) to revamp the whole website and make it way better than anything I could do with wordpress.

## The Changelog (Lots of cool stuff)
- Fully revamped the colours of the site, making it look really nice to look at.
- Make some of the text bigger and more readable, increasing the line size as well.
- Put a preview of some of my blog posts on the homepage to make it seem less empty.
- Added accent hover effects to stuff like the navigation bar, some hyperlinks also show it (Like the Instagram/GitHub icons and all the icons on the experience page).
- Added some more stuff to my experience page, I added a bunch of icons for software/services im experienced with to help people understand it better.
- Changed the website font to something I think looks a lot nicer than the old one, hopefully you agree.

Theres much more to come! This is 2-3 days worth of work alone. I still need to finish off these and optimize them for mobile clients but the desktop experience should work perfectly fine.

Speaking of the mobile experience, it is very rough right now, its still kinda usable but not recommended unless you have to use it.
