slug: huge-website-revamp


I've been using wordpress for ~2 months and I just got bored of it, there were some cool themes and stuff but they were all pretty souless and I couldn't make it "my own". So I moved back to my custom website to revamp it, which included the added benefit of more flexibility and control.

## Detailed Changelog

- Changed all the websites colours, set css variables for consistency
- Improved reading experience by making the text bigger, and increasing line size
- Added a small preview of some of my blog posts on the homepage to make it less empty
- Added accent hover effects to stuff like the navigation bar and social buttons
- Expanded the experience page, expansions include a new simplified "everything I know" section
- Changed the font to something nicer to look at

There's much more to come! This is 2-3 days worth of work alone, still need to finish off the above and optimize them for mobile clients but the desktop experience should work perfectly fine.

On the mobile side of things it's still usable but not recommended, use desktop whenever possible.
