Welcome to my first website update changelog! In this one I have made some pretty minor changes but they're still very cool and still definitely noticeable

Here is a list of all the changes I made since making the first new website post

###  Frontend changes

- Made the UI buttons a bit darker
- Made the background & boxes darker
- **Rebranded the entire website to be around alecks.dev instead of a3d.pro**
- You can now see all the blog post dates without going into them
- Items on the projects page now show what languages they were made in
- **There is now a comment system on all blogs and some pages using github discussions**

### Backend changes

- Added analytics and tracking (Privacy preserving) using a self-hosted umami instance
- Deployed the website on a brand new high-performance vps server
- The container now uses internal docker networking instead of exposing a port
