title: Shutting down Cloudy
date: 2024-03-30
description: I am ending my old project Cloudy bot, because I am moving on from bot development to work on much cooler and more enjoyable projects. Bot dev has been fun but its quite limiting and gets old quickly.
slug: ending-cloudy

## Why its happening
I don't enjoy working on the bot anymore and I lack the motivation to continue building new features. On top of this I recieve no funding for the bot and have to pay for its infrastructure out of my own pocket.

## What im gonna do now
I'm going to move on to new and more enjoyable projects either in the game dev world or in web dev. This project will always be remembered as one of my first successful and (kinda) high quality projects.

## Whats happening to all its assets
I am going to either delete or private every single thing I have connected to this bot, except for the repository which houses all of the code for the bot, that will stay open source for as long as possible

## Why delete everything
It makes the change feel more major and brings more attention to it so I can ensure everyone who should know about it knows about it, not that the bot is used that much anyway.
