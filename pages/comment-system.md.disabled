### Notice: I have removed this (for now) as its been breaking and causing lots of issues.

I have just recently added a commenting system to my website which appears on some pages and on all of my blog posts, it uses a system called gicus which integrates with Github Discussions to allow me to host comment sections without having to worry about authentication, storage or any of that.

You wil see the box below and it simply just lets you login with github, after you do that you will be able to comment as much as you want. You can add the system to your website too if you have one, obviously no point doing it if you use wordpress or anything like that though since they have integrated comment systems.

In some ways this system is actually better than Wordpress commenting, since a lot of people have github and it means that users don't have to share personal information with the website owner when they may not trust them that much with it.
